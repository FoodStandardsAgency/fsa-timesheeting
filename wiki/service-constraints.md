## Understanding service constraints

Service constraints describe the things that should be taken into consideration by anyone working on service design, development and delivery.

Constraints are not necessarily blockers to change or improvement; they are critical considerations that must be accounted for in any service design and product development.

Constraints should be reviewed regularly and updated as necessary through the service lifecycle.

# Governance of the Food Standards Agency

The FSA is an independent, non-ministerial government department, governed by a board rather than directly by Ministers. The board ensures the FSA fulfils their legal obligations so that all decisions or actions take scientific advice and the interests of consumers into consideration. Daily management of the agency is delegated to officials reporting to the Chief Executive.

# Governance of the timesheeting service
The timesheet service was implemented to support the delivery of legal and regulatory requirements in relation to charging for meat plant inspections. As such, the overarching framework within which the service operates is governed by EU and UK legislation and regulations; day-to-day operation of the service is governed by FSA policy, processes and procedures that interpret the legislation and regulations.

## Legislation that governs the timesheeting service
The finance provisions set out in Articles 26, 27 and 28 of Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004 (the EC Regulations) require FSA meat hygiene and animal welfare at slaughter charges (official controls charges) to be raised to Food Business Operators (FBOs). 

These provisions came into force in law across England and Wales from 28 September 2009 under the following regulations:
* The Meat (Official Controls Charges) (England) Regulations 2009
* The Meat (Official Controls Charges) (Wales) Regulations 2009

The legislation requires that the FSA must charge FBOs for the meat hygiene official controls that the FSA carries out and must calculate FBO charges in line with the requirements of those regulations.

Full copies of all of these regulations are available at www.legislation.gov.uk/. 

Within this document, the English and Welsh regulations are referred to as ‘the Charges Regulations ’. A copy of Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004 (referred to in this document as ‘the EC Regulation’) about charges for official controls can be found at: http://eurlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.douri=CELEX:32004R0882R(01):EN:HTML.

> UK consultation for this change is ongoing. The UK does not currently anticipate any change to its charging policy but pending progress in the UK's exit from the European Union there may be changes in the delivery approach.

## Policy that governs the timesheeting service

The data held in the SIR system has been reviewed and documented in the "**SIR DATABASE AUDIT REPORT**", produced by BDO, to assess GDPR risk.

The report notes that there is no significant risk from personal information being held in SIR.

Staff information is held in the FSA corporate HR system, which is assessed separately.

Contractor information is held in Establishments and People (E&P) which stores data in the SIR database and is therefore included in the above report.

# Problem statement

Our service to inspect food plants is constrained by outdated and inflexible technology, notably a bespoke timesheeting system. 

The service doesn’t meet our users needs or allow data to flow and support downstream invoice and payment processing. Business processes are therefore inefficient, having been built around these legacy constraints.


# Hypothesis

We hypothesise that:
- Timesheets are harder to enter and approve than they should be.
- The service is constrained by outdated and inflexible technology.
- Data doesn’t flow across systems and business processes are less efficient as a result.
- The service is not designed for the practical limitations of meat plant environments.

These issues impact people entering timesheet records, and that this has a knock-on impact for those approving them, and payroll and charging teams who rely on the data entered. 

# Goals

The discovery will allow us to understand pain-points and opportunities across:
- User needs and business value of the service
- Current business processes being operated by the service
- Existing technology enabling the delivery of the service
- Underlying data the service is running on

This will enable us to design and deliver an improved service that meets user and business needs, ideally with reduced costs, operational overhead and freed from the legacy technology and data constraints.

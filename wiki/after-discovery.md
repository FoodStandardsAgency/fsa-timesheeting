### What happens next?
The next phase is **Prototyping**, where we try out different solutions to the problems we learnt about during the Discovery.

This means:
- Building prototypes
- Testing different ideas
- Challenging the way things are done
- Exploring new approaches

This activity can inform the priorities for an extended alpha development phase, which typically runs over 8-10 weeks, and is more collaborative and hands-on than Discovery.

### Who's involved?
- **Core team** (including analysis, design and development): day-to-day delivery
- **Field Ops** team members (including Digital Superusers): for testing, feedback and continued input. 
- **HR & Finance** service users: testing, feedback and validation
- **DDAT community:** additional challenge, support and potential wider FSA sharing
- **Other FSA discovery teams:** shared learning, best practice

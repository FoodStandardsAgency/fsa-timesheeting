# Service definition
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is legally obliged to charge for inspection work conducted at meat plants in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This work is performed by Meat Hygiene Inspectors (MHI) and Official Veterinarians (OV) working directly for the FSA or on a contract basis via service delivery partners (SDP).

The timesheeting service provides MHIs and OVs  with the capability to record their working hours against defined activities.

This capability is an enabling component of finance and payroll processes. The data collected from MHIs and OVs is passed to charging and payroll systems and processed to:

- Populate scheduled activity and charging reports.
- Invoice food business operators for inspection services provided by the FBO.
- Pay service delivery partners for contract staff who help to deliver inspection services on behalf of the FSA.
- Pay FSA staff for overtime, as per their contracted terms and conditions.
- Pay FSA casual staff who provide inspection services to support the FSA on an informal basis.



# Mission

The timesheeting service will ensure that:
- Food Business Operators and other government departments are appropriately billed for food plant inspection time;
- Service Delivery Partners and contract staff are paid accurately for services provided;
- FSA staff are paid any due overtime and allowances in a timely manner.

# Vision
The timesheeting service should:
- Streamline user experience for front-line operational staff (minimal time overhead)
- Timesheet input method that supports correctness and accuracy (increased data quality)

- Reporting that supports the combined team in running a smooth service by e.g. identifying anomalies and drawing attention to data that need checking.

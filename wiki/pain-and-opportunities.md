# Service Pain
## Success criteria (September 2019)
The following service level pains have been identified in the course of Discovery:
No. |Lifecycle stage  |Timesheeting activity      | Pain  | 
----|------------|-------------------- | --------------------- |
1 | Manage legislation, policy and business rules | Define FSA policy and procedures | Policy and process change may require the revision of government regulations and significantly extended timescales for implementation
2 | Manage legislation, policy and business rules | Define FSA policy and procedures | Policy, process and procedure change requires engagement with the relevant industry bodies and consensus on any revisions.
2 | Manage timesheet system user | Activate timesheet user | SDP can notify CSU of new starter at short notice.
2 | Manage timesheet system user | Activate timesheet user | Delays in the authorisation process have an impact on: the ability to submit timesheets; and the accuracy of the charging process.
2 | Manage timesheet system user | Activate timesheet user | MHIs/OV have been known to start work before they have been set up in the timesheeting system.
3 | Manage timesheet system user | Re-activate timesheet user | Eville & Jones (incumbent SDP) has a relatively high churn of contract staff.
3 | Manage timesheet system user | Re-activate timesheet user | Contract MHIs and OVs may have more than one staff number depending on the number of SDPs they are contracted to, their role and responsibilities.
3 | Manage timesheet system user | Re-activate timesheet user | MHIs/OV have been known to start work before they have been set up in the timesheeting system.
4 | Manage timesheet system user | Deactivate timesheet user | FSA are not consistently notified by the SDP when contractors roll off FSA work.
4 | Manage timesheet system user | Deactivate timesheet user | It is difficult to track when contract users no longer require system access.
5 | Submit timesheets | Submit timesheet | The nature of MHI/OV work and the environment in which they work makes it difficult to comply with the guideline to complete timesheets daily.
5 | Submit timesheets | Submit timesheet |  The technology and connectivity available to MHIs/OVs from plant to plant creates a dependency that impacts their ability to complete timesheets daily and submit weekly.
6 | Manage timesheets | Review timesheets | Contract MHIs and OVs may have more than one staff number depending on the number of SDPs they are contracted to, their role and responsibilities. 
6 | Manage timesheets | Review timesheets | Where SDP managers identify timesheet errors they must request any amendments via the ITL responsible for the plant. They cannot make amendments themselves.
6 | Manage timesheets | Review timesheets | ITLs must review multiple reports and other sources of information to check and validate timesheets.
7 | Manage timesheets | Amend timesheets | Any amendment to timesheets puts pressure on the charging process timetable, increases ITL workloads, and increases the number of handovers to rectify and repeat the timesheet submission process.
7 | Manage timesheets | Amend timesheets | Where the charging or payment processes are delayed there is an impact on the FBO and/or individuals staff/contractors
8 | Use timesheet data | Manage Statement of Resources | There may be a discrepancy between the SOR and current/ongoing working patterns and deliverables at a given plant. Accurate and consistent day book and timesheet information helps drive discussion and agreement with FBOs.
10 | Use timesheet data | Produce timesheet and charging reports | Missing and/or inaccurate timesheet data is reflected in reports.
11 | Use timesheet data | Process FBO charges | Missing timesheets means charging is incomplete.
11 | Use timesheet data | Process FBO charges |  Inaccurate timesheet data: creates work in chasing ITLs and field operations staff and impacts the charging process timetable; could mean FBOs invoices are incorrect and must be amended later; and could mean FSA and contract staff are over- or underpaid and must be reconciled later. 
12 | Use timesheet data | Collect unpaid charges | Inaccurate or incomplete information could impede the ability to respond to legal challenges.
12 | Use timesheet data | Collect unpaid charges | Inaccurate data could cause reputational damage to the FSA.
12 | Use timesheet data | Collect unpaid charges | Not following policy can result in a legal challenge.
12 | Use timesheet data | Collect unpaid charges | Shortfall in FSA income and subsequent review of agency budget.
13 | Use timesheet data | Pay FSA staff | Timesheet errors create rework to adjust salary payments in the following month. (Automated process through data transfer between systems).
13 | Use timesheet data | Pay FSA staff | Timesheet errors require manual intervention to correct and pay leavers in time.
14 | Use timesheet data | Pay contractors | Timesheet errors create rework to adjust salary payments in the following month.
14 | Use timesheet data | Pay contractors | Timesheet errors require manual intervention to correct and pay leavers.
14 | Use timesheet data | Pay contractors | Incorrect FBO charges are raised.
15 | Support timesheet system | Manage incident ticket | Not all calls to the Littlefish helpdesk require technical support and need to be directed to Revenue Accounting for policy and process guidance.
16 | Support timesheet system | Manage timesheet query | Revenue Accounting teams field queries across a range of subjects that may or may not be specifically related to the timesheeting system. There is no formal log of these calls.
16 | Support timesheet system | Manage timesheet query | Guides, documentation and support materials are available to users but it is not clear people are using them in the field.
17 | Maintain timesheet system | Update timesheet system screens; Manage plants, sites and activities | As owners of the timesheeting system, RA are dependent on third parties to configure the application.
17 | Maintain timesheet system | Update timesheet system screens; Manage plants, sites and activities | It takes time for change/improvement requests to progress from the IT backlog.
17 | Maintain timesheet system | Update timesheet system screens; Manage plants, sites and activities | There is a cost associated with change requests and development work. 

# User Pain
The following user pains have been identified in the course of Discovery:
- There is some **duplication of effort** within the service.
- Internal service providers **manually process** large amounts of data.
- Users are spending time **chasing incomplete or missing information**.
- Internal service providers have to **manually search** for data.

## Timesheet Inputters
- **Lots of mental maths involved** in inputting a timesheet
- There are **no notifications** to let workers know if my timesheet has been rejected. They have to wait for a manager to informally contact them
- There are **lots of activity codes involved in simple tasks** - for example, logging an away day
- It can be difficult to log onto the system sometimes due to **connectivity issues** at the plant
- The **system does not show workers the SOR agreed hours** to help them allocate their time- they have to have these to hand or know these by heart
- The **UI is very cramped** and small making it difficult to see
- The **system forces workers to enter break times even if they were on holiday**
- The **timesheet is locked once workers send it to a manager** meaning they have to contact a manager if they've made a mistake
- The **system doesn’t know a worker's contractual overtime** - they have to enter this manually every time
-  Workers who work accross sites have to record their daily activity in their own notebook or phone as **workers can’t view the daybook for all sites** when they enter my timesheet
- **Contract workers have to send their timesheet twice** - once to FSA and once to their SDP

## Timesheet Managers
- The **data is spread across far too many screens** - they'd like a single view for one worker. Too many clicks and scrolls!
- When ITLs view breakdown of a worker, they see all activities for that worker including sites that aren’t under their remit
- The **system doesn’t provide notifications** so ITLs have to manually communicate with workers to let them know their timesheet is declined
- The **system doesn’t tell ITLs when a worker has re-submitted their declined timesheet**
- The r**eview process is very time consuming** because ITLs have to review every single worker. There is an appetite to manager by exception
- The **system does not consider the SOR or a worker’s contract** meaning all of the cross-checking is manual. One ITL had created their own spreadsheet to cross-check this automatically
- ITLs **can’t access the system on a mobile phone** or tablet when in the field



# Opportunities 
- Automated integration with other systems 
  - Double entry in IHR and Timesheeting
  - Include data from SOR and worker's contract
 - Implement automated notifications in the system workflow
 - Allow users to edit their timesheet up until the charging deadline
 - Improve UI  - layout, display, flow
- Automate sending of contract worker timesheet data to SDP - email or API
- Offline caching and sync of timesheet entry
- Allow the timesheeting system to be used on mobile devices
- Improve timesheet filters for ITLs
- Consider how ITLs may be able to manage by exception using SOR data to automate some of the cross-checking process

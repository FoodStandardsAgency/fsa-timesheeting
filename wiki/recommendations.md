# Summary of Findings 
## Themes
The main themes in our findings - which reinforce previous research projects - are that:
- Connectivity and system access slow down entering and reviewing timesheets
- Users need to manually cross-check against a number of data sources (eg, SOR, rota, IHR)
- Errors are easy to make, and the system doesnâ€™t give users helpful or timely feedback
- Existing technology is not designed to meet modern standards

Additionally, plant environment and operations create time pressures and the service charging cycle creates timeline pressures that contribute to data entry errors and re-work. 

## Opportunity
By helping Field Ops users save just minutes and seconds from their input and review process, the FSA can realise efficiency benefits based on the [volume of timesheeting](/volumes-and-metrics) that takes place each week. 

The system could do more heavy lifting to reduce the cognitive friction for users and smooth the user experience, such as by: 
- challenging user entry before it is submitted
- adding up the hours logged
- presenting a comparison with SOR headline volumes
- knowing and modelling business rules and working patterns 
- providing appropriate user feedback and notifications 

## Goals
Updating the timesheeting service to focus on these key re-design goals can help meet [user needs](/user-needs) and address the [recurring themes](/pain-and-opportunities): 
1. Enter timesheets by exception to rota
1. Manage timesheets by exception to SOR
1. Relieve connectivity issues
1. Address user remote access issues 

## Core Premise
There is a recurring question about whether timesheeting is even necessary. The reality is the [current legislation](/governance-overview) makes it unavoidable. Changing the business model of inspections charging that might eliminate it is a long term endeavour. In the meantime there are very practical and manageable steps that can be taken to make it a more efficient and effective service.

# Next Phase Recommendations
There are two key areas to test against to begin that service transformation process:

## 1. **Prototype user experience improvements** 
Focusing on pivotal user journey stages that impact timely and accurate data entry and timesheet management: 
- simplified timesheet entry
- comparing rota vs hours worked
- user notifications
- SOR reconciliation 

A prototyping stage should investigate options for dealing with the following constraints:
- accessibility standards: as required for government applications by The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 legislation
- established FSA design patterns: including as set by the DHI Mobile service
- offline data sources: such as ITL rotas
&nbsp;

## 2. **Investigate remote access options**
With particular attention to supporting:  
- mobile user experience with offline sync
- balance of security and remote access performance issues

A prototyping stage should investigate options for dealing with the following constraints:
- Plant setup and mobile signal
- Security for user and device authentication

# Beyond Prototyping
The core opportunity for timesheeting can be addressed from different ranges:
- Short: **User experience** of timesheet entry and management
- Medium: **Integrated systems and data** for better rules modelling
- Long: Streamline across **operational and partner** needs
  - Business rules and internal policy
  - Industry agreements
  - SDP and FBO relationship management
- Distant: Engage legislative process to revise **charging model**

Considering such an approach, and starting with the initial prototyping suggestions, the FSA can take a multi-layered and incremental approach to service and platform transformation. 

Beyond the immediate scope of the timesheeting system (identified above as short range), additional longer-range considerations include:

 * **Review time recording policy**: understand if/how current practice can be modified (within the constraints of legislation and current accepted food industry practice) to improve the timesheeting process, whilst still meeting obligations. Identify areas where policy change could enable the process to be further improved in future.
 * **Review SDP and FBO support** provided by FSA for onboarding (and offboarding) sites and contractors, to help ensure consistent and scaleable experiences.
 * **Consider service and product ownership** to align Field Ops and Finance needs across the timesheeting service and systems.
 * **Review existing front-end and back-end systems**: rationalise the current landscape, including data flows between systems, to identify opportunities to reduce manual effort (time), duplication of data storage (cost) and avoids information transmission via email (risk) where this is practical. The FSA SIR Audit Report should provide useful input to this process.
 * **Identify opportunities to automate data exchange**: move towards API integration where possible with external organisations and/or extend processes to those organisations (e.g. with externally-facing user interfaces) in order to reduce burden on FSA staff (e.g. involve Service Delivery Partner in on-boarding contractors)

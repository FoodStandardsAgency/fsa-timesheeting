<h1>User journeys</h1>
<p>After undertaking our discovery research, we created journey maps for our two main groups of users - timesheet inputters and timesheet managers.</p>
<p>The map details the journey users undertake along with their user needs, touch points and pain points. We have also outlined any opportunities for improvements.</p>

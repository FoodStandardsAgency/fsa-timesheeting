## Understand success criteria

Service success criteria describe the required outcome for each user group completing an activity in the timesheeting lifecycle. These could be considered the high-level acceptance criteria to be met by anyone working on service design, development and delivery.

Success criteria should be reviewed regularly and re-validated as necessary through the service lifecycle. 


### Four service analysis measures
Four key measures of success were used to assess the timesheeting service in Discovery.

Measure | Summary (September 2019)
------- | -----
**Enables business outcome?** | The as-is timesheeting service supports the delivery of revenue and accounting objectives; **but** introduces potential points of failure that impact the charging and payroll processes.
**Fit for purpose?** | The as-is timesheeting system functions for field operations; **but** is delivered in a format that is at odds with their way of working and their working environment.
**Supports getting your job done?** | The timesheeting system enables field operations to support revenue and accounting objectives; **but** it increases the field operations workload, and introduces pressure points in the working week of both field operations and revenue & accounting.
**Removes constraints?** | The as-is timesheeting service goes some way to enabling the implementation of regulatory processes and procedures; **but** the way the service is made available to field operations introduces additional constraints in terms of technology; and inefficient ways of using/reusing information. The owners of the system have a dependency on third parties to make iterative improvements to the service.
